# Growtopia Z-Builder C# (Old)
Z-Builder written in C#. Older and worse features than the C++ version but easier for newbies to understand.
# Features
- Builder with some basic features such as trace save.dat, copy to startup and webhook sending (Discord Integrated).<br/>
- Decoding that hasn't been patched. (Growtopia used to change the save.dat encryption every few updates).
# How to use:
Compile the source code. <br/>
This can be done after you remove all instances of "AntiDelete" from the source code (ctrl + f is a good method). <br/>
You must also delete or replace the license links depending if you would like a license key system however this is very basic and can be bypassed with a HTTP Debugger such as Fiddler Everywhere. <br/>
If you have any extra errors / questions DO NOT message anyone other than Stex#7963.
